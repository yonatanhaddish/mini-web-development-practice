          The <b>chicken <i>(Gallus gallus domesticus)</i></b> is a domesticated
          junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey
          and the Ceylon junglefowl<sup>[1]</sup> that are originally from
          Southeastern Asia. <b>Rooster or cock</b> is a term for an adult male
          bird, and a younger male may be called a <b>cockerel</b>. A male that
          has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a
          <b>hen</b> and a sexually immature female is called a <b>pullet</b>.
          Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both
          their meat and eggs) and as pets. Traditionally they were also bred
          for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places.

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
          According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e. a roosting bird)
          originated in the mid- or late 18th century as a euphemism to avoid
          the sexual connotation of the original English
          cock<sup>[23][24][25]</sup>, and is widely used throughout North
          America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at
          night.<sup>[26]</sup>

        <h2>General biology and habitant</h2>
        <p>
          Chickens are omnivores.<sup>[27]</sup> the wild, they often scratch at
          the soil to search for seeds, insects, and even animals as large as
          lizards, small snakes,<sup>[28]</sup> or sometimes young mice.<sup

          The average chicken may live for 5-10 years, depending on the
          breed.<sup>[30]</sup> The world's oldest known chicken lived 16 years
          according to Guinness World Records.<sup>[31]</sup>
          <br />
          <br>
          Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking
          plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their
          necks ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of
          brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed.
          However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has
          only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The
          identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from
          the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in
          certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by
          colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a
          comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their
          beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy
          protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. Both the
          adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these
          are more prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found
          in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the
          chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.<sup>[32]</sup>
          <br />
          <br>
          Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although
          lighter chickens are generally capable of flying for short distances,
          such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost).
          Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings,
          but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.
